In todays's digital world, many are the dangers that internet users are faced with, from the most annoying scam emails to phishing and proper viruses and malwares.

So what are some good practices for today's average internet user?
First, one of the biggest vulnerable points is passwords. It is better practice to use multiple passwords for different accounts and platforms, so that getting acces to all of them at the same time will be harder for a potential hacker.

Another very important thing is to be careful when receiving messages or e-mails from unwanted or unknown sources. There is always a risk of downloading malwares and viruses, so better try to avoid files and links that look suspicious.

Is also crucial to not share online any kind of password, PINs, ID informations or bank related data to anyone, even to account that look like official and professional.

In addtion to these personal related problematics, the modern internet user has also to be worried about what he uses to access the internet.
Specifically, it's always best to be careful when connecting to public WI-FI networks and also, to use devices that are not ours for purposes that involve using confidential and sensible personal information.

Lastly, but not for this less importantly, our devices could potentially have some weaknesses against cyber attacks. That's why companies work non stop to provide their users with security updates and patches, so it's very important to keep every device up to date.

Following this simple guidelines is not guranteeing our security, but paired with common sense it can help to greatly reduce the risks of being an internet user.
